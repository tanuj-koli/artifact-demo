I've had a lot of fun working on this coding project! This web-app uses the React Flow library to enable users to diagram concurrently with nodes and edges.

Concurrency Features:
🤝 Rooms where multiple clients can access and simultaneously edit

Control Features:
🌱 Node creation (bottom-left node icon)
🔒 Diagram locking (lock icon)
🖼️ Diagram refocusing (border icon)
🔎 Zoom in/out (+/- icons)
🗺️ Interactive minimap

Node Features:
🔌 Connect nodes via edges
📖 Access node details (click node)
🤓 Name node + add details
🎨 Change node color + contrasting text
🍞 Action confirmation toasts (bottom right)
